<p>An account of the people, events, experiences, and influences impactful as I see myself today. We all change as time passes with wrinkles and grey hair, even some new hair and the places it grows.</p>
<p> This approach has given me unique insights into connections and ideas that often go unnoticed. Into my early 20s, I found myself reflecting on the lessons learned, as the context of the lesson Came up in my actual life without. analogously or not, I found myself feeling I. gratitude well, I remembered. when the lesson was taught. Having a record, Like the simplicity of animalism. similar to advice for journaling where you write regularly and get both a good and the bad out of your head and on the paper especially with the ones that distress.</p>
<And I think I would just take a nice piece of wood, some wire, maybe an old shower. I mean to connectors, shower balls, and then. p>There is a processing in the process Thoughts that are tied to emotions out on paper. especially the. troubling ones.. knowing that it's on paper removes the. reasoning is often subconscious or quiet needs to stay swimming around the forefront of your head. </p>
<p>Reflecting on my experiences since my teenage years, like when I tackled my first major challenge with a 1986 Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera at age 16, I learned valuable lessons. Faced with what seemed like a disastrous breakdown, I transformed a daunting $1,500 repair into a $120 DIY project. By asking the right questions and breaking down the problem, I not only fixed the car but also gained a profound belief in the power of persistence. That experience, much like the grease-smudged pages of a Haynes Manual, continues to influence my approach to life and work.</p>
<p>My varied career, from stockbroking in my twenties to lifelong building and designing, has equipped me to view the world through a unique lens—everything is as simple as lefty-loosey, righty-tighty. Whether discussing return on investment or designing intricate master-key systems, or planning advanced remodeling projects for energy efficiency in my properties, I apply the same analytical rigor. The goal? To transform each property into a nearly self-sustaining unit, reducing dependence on external utilities and creating a miniature green powerhouse.</p>
